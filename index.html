<h2>The Last Few Games</h2>
<header>Craig Bohl, September 10, 2016</header>
<p>The Wyoming Cowboys football season kicked on Saturday, September 2 against the
Northern Illinois Huskies.  The game went into triple overtime with the score 
going back and forth between the Huskies and the Cowboys.  In the third overtime,
Josh Allen, #17 and the quarterback for the Cowboys, won the game with a touchdown.
The final score was Cowboys-40, Huskies-34.</p>
<p>On Saturday, September 10, the Cowboys had a difficult game against the Nebraska
Huskers.  The game went back and forth a couple of times, but the second half the game,
the Huskers had four interceptions, and took a big league.  The ending score was Huskers-52,
Cowboys-17.  Craig Bohl had this to say about the game:  <blockquote>You know at that time I
thought that the game was fairly evenly matched. I know we missed a couple scoring opportunities
on field goals and we weren't able to convert as many times on third down and makeable as we
would have liked. There were some positive things. Our depth came into play. I want to credit
Nebraska too. I thought they responded well.</blockquote></p>
